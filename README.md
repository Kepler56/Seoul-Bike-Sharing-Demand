# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand
<hr>

## Project Description
Bike sharing is a transportation system that allows individuals to rent bicycles for short periods, typically for a few hours or less, and return them to designated stations 
or docking points. It offers a convenient and flexible means of transportation, especially for short-distance trips within urban areas. By analyzing historical bike rental 
data along with other relevant factors such as weather conditions, holidays, and time of day we can develop models to predict the demand for bikes in the future. 
This information is crucial for bike-sharing operators to ensure an adequate supply of bikes at each location, optimize bike distribution, and meet the demand of users 
especially during peak hours or busy periods.

This project aims to **predict the number of bikes required at each hour for a stable supply of rental bikes in urban cities**. The prediction of bike count is based on various factors such as weather conditions, holidays, and functional hours.

## Findings

### Analysis
- The number of bikes rented is higher during the Summer and Autumn seasons, likely due to the warmer weather. This observation supports the strong correlation between temperature and bike rentals, as temperatures are generally warmer in summer. Additionally, the season with the lowest number of rented bikes is Winter, which can be attributed to colder weather conditions.

- The number of bikes rented is higher during non-holiday periods, indicating that people are more likely to utilize bikes for daily commuting rather than recreational purposes during holidays. This finding aligns with the assumption that individuals use bikes for transportation to work.

- During weekdays, there is a noticeable trend in bike rental times, with two prominent peaks occurring around 8 am and 6 pm. These peaks indicate that people are using bikes for their daily commute to work in the morning and returning home in the evening. Moreover, even though there is a lower number of rented bicycles during the weekend, there is still a gradual increase in rentals during the afternoons.

### Models

Among the various models we evaluated, the **Random Forest Regressor** had the best performance. It achieved an impressive **R2 score of 0.90**, 
indicating its ability to explain a significant portion of the variance in the data. During training, the model exhibited exceptional accuracy with 
a **score of 0.99**.

Here is the barplot indicating the comparison between the different models:
